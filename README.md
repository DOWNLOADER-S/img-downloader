# IMG-downloader

During a period of magazine advertising, publishers offered a copy of the magazine for free on an online reading site: [CalamÃ©o](https://calameo.com). Unfortunately, if the person uploading the file to the site does not offer the download, the document cannot be read offline.

It is by starting from this principle and by failing with the other proposed methods, that I decided to build a shell ("*and a batch script*" -- in reflexion) in order to:
- download all the images of the file proposed for reading
- merge the images in a PDF file
- allow the final PDF to be downloaded from any device (by FTP and deposit on a free server)
- **all in one action!**

> **In the end, in about 1 min for ~40 images (pages), you get your file ready to view and store wherever you want!**

# 3 ways to do
- **[UNIX](#unix)** : see all the details delow
- **WINDOWS** (1) : use a **virtual machine** to run the above UNIX script ([tutorial link](https://medium.com/platform-engineer/how-to-install-debian-linux-on-virtualbox-with-guest-additions-778afa0ee7e0)) -- **other simpler solutions will arrive**
- **WINDOWS** (2) : A command line user version is now available but it is definitely not finalized and we **do not recommend its use at this time**. If you still want to use it, just run the script **as administrator** and answer the questions. *This script only downloads images from magazines and does not merge them into PDF*.

## UNIX
*Required* :
It is necessary to install the git package in order to clone the script and the directory on your device.
```{bash}
apt install git
```

### Install Git clone
Here are the packages that will be installed from the script (dependencies are not listed): `img2pdf` and `rename`.
```{bash}
git clone https://framagit.org/downloader-s/img-downloader.git
cd img-downloader
chmod u+x down_img.sh
```
### Run the code
"Basically" and interactively. Simply run the script and answer the questions.
```{bash}
./down_img.sh
```
### Update Git clone
It may be necessary in the future to update this script. For this it is extremely important to place yourself in the git folder "img-downloader" (say in the code) and to execute the code below:
```{bash}
cd img-downloader
git reset --hard HEAD && git checkout master && git pull
chmod u+x down_img.sh 
```
